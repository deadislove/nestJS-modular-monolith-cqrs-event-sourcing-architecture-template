## Description

[Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository.

## 🧭 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a modular monolith architecture using [Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest), incorporating CQRS and Event Sourcing patterns. It supports dynamic event store providers and adheres to Domain-Driven Design principles, providing a scalable and maintainable foundation for application development.

## 🏗️ Project Structure & Architecture

The application follows a modular monolith approach with clear bounded contexts. Each module encapsulates its domain logic, application services, and infrastructure concerns. The architecture is layered as follows:

- Domain Layer: Entities, value objects, and domain services.
- Application Layer: Commands, queries, handlers, and facades.
- Infrastructure Layer: Repositories, event stores, and external integrations.
- Interface Layer: Controllers and API endpoints.

The event store integration is achieved through a factory pattern with dynamic modules, allowing seamless switching between MongoDB, Kafka, and EventStoreDB.

## 🧩 Modular Breakdown

Each module resides under the src/modules directory and includes:

- Application: Commands, queries, handlers, services, and DTOs.
- Domain: Entities and interfaces.
- Infrastructure: Repositories and ORM entities.
- Interfaces: Controllers and API definitions.

This separation ensures a clear structure and promotes maintainability.

## ✨ Key Features

- Modular monolith architecture with clear bounded contexts
- CQRS and Event Sourcing patterns
- Dynamic event store integration (MongoDB, Kafka, EventStoreDB)
- JWT authentication and authorization
- Comprehensive logging, custom decorators, interceptors, and exception handling
- Dockerized setup with support for SQLite and PostgreSQL

## 🧠 Design Principles and Benefits

- Domain-Driven Design (DDD): Ensures alignment with business domains and promotes a ubiquitous language.
- Onion Architecture: Separates concerns and enforces dependency inversion.
- Scalability: Modular design allows for independent scaling of modules.
- Maintainability: Clear separation of concerns facilitates easier maintenance and testing.
- Flexibility: Dynamic event store integration allows for easy switching between different providers.

## 🚀 PoC to PMC Ready

The project is structured to evolve from a Proof of Concept (PoC) to a Production-Ready (PMC) application. It includes:

- Comprehensive testing strategies
- CI/CD pipeline configurations
- Environment-based configurations
- Scalable and maintainable codebase

## Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your NestJS application to production, there are some key steps you can take to ensure it runs as efficiently as possible. Check out the [deployment documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/deployment) for more information.

If you are looking for a cloud-based platform to deploy your NestJS application, check out [Mau](https://mau.nestjs.com), our official platform for deploying NestJS applications on AWS. Mau makes deployment straightforward and fast, requiring just a few simple steps:

```bash
$ npm install -g mau
$ mau deploy
```

With Mau, you can deploy your application in just a few clicks, allowing you to focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure.
