## üß≠ Project Overview

This project demonstrates a modular monolith architecture using [Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest), incorporating CQRS and Event Sourcing patterns. It supports dynamic event store providers and adheres to Domain-Driven Design principles, providing a scalable and maintainable foundation for application development.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure & Architecture

The application follows a modular monolith approach with clear bounded contexts. Each module encapsulates its domain logic, application services, and infrastructure concerns. The architecture is layered as follows:

- Domain Layer: Entities, value objects, and domain services.
- Application Layer: Commands, queries, handlers, and facades.
- Infrastructure Layer: Repositories, event stores, and external integrations.
- Interface Layer: Controllers and API endpoints.

The event store integration is achieved through a factory pattern with dynamic modules, allowing seamless switching between MongoDB, Kafka, and EventStoreDB.

## üß© Modular Breakdown

Each module resides under the src/modules directory and includes:

- Application: Commands, queries, handlers, services, and DTOs.
- Domain: Entities and interfaces.
- Infrastructure: Repositories and ORM entities.
- Interfaces: Controllers and API definitions.

This separation ensures a clear structure and promotes maintainability.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- Modular monolith architecture with clear bounded contexts
- CQRS and Event Sourcing patterns
- Dynamic event store integration (MongoDB, Kafka, EventStoreDB)
- JWT authentication and authorization
- Comprehensive logging, custom decorators, interceptors, and exception handling
- Dockerized setup with support for SQLite and PostgreSQL

## üß† Design Principles and Benefits

- Domain-Driven Design (DDD): Ensures alignment with business domains and promotes a ubiquitous language.
- Onion Architecture: Separates concerns and enforces dependency inversion.
- Scalability: Modular design allows for independent scaling of modules.
- Maintainability: Clear separation of concerns facilitates easier maintenance and testing.
- Flexibility: Dynamic event store integration allows for easy switching between different providers.

## üöÄ PoC to PMC Ready

The project is structured to evolve from a Proof of Concept (PoC) to a Production-Ready (PMC) application. It includes:

- Comprehensive testing strategies
- CI/CD pipeline configurations
- Environment-based configurations
- Scalable and maintainable codebase

## ‚ö° Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deadislove/nestJS-modular-monolith-cqrs-event-sourcing-architecture-template.git
cd nestJS-modular-monolith-cqrs-event-sourcing-architecture-template
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Compile and run the project

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

5. Run tests:

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```

6. Run the application:

Navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

For Docker-based setup, refer to the docker-compose.sqlite.yml or docker-compose.postgresql.yml files.

- Run with SQLite (default)

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.sqlite.yml up
# or 
docker-compose -f docker-compose.sqlite.yml up --build
```

- Run with PostgreSQL

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.postgresql.yml up
# or 
docker-compose -f docker-compose.postgresql.yml up --build
```

## Logging

Application logs are automatically saved to the logs/ directory with daily log rotation (e.g., application-2025-04-27.log).

## Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your NestJS application to production, there are some key steps you can take to ensure it runs as efficiently as possible. Check out the [deployment documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/deployment) for more information.

If you are looking for a cloud-based platform to deploy your NestJS application, check out [Mau](https://mau.nestjs.com), our official platform for deploying NestJS applications on AWS. Mau makes deployment straightforward and fast, requiring just a few simple steps:

```bash
$ npm install -g mau
$ mau deploy
```

With Mau, you can deploy your application in just a few clicks, allowing you to focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure.
